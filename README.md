# IMIC_SDE
IMIC_SDE stands for Intel Many Integrated Core Software Development Emulator. Intel no longer allows access or distributes Intel MIC SDE, so I made a functional alternative. Supports Knights Landing (KNL), and Knights Corner (KNC). Includes internal NoC simulation for accurate real-world performance estimation.
